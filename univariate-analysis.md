## Pareto Analysis on Categorical Columns
[source](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/pareto-analysis-step-by-step.php)

Here are eight steps to identifying the principal causes you should focus on, using Pareto Analysis:
- Create a vertical bar chart with causes on the x-axis and count (number of occurrences) on the y-axis.
- Arrange the bar chart in descending order of cause importance that is, the cause with the highest count first.
- Calculate the cumulative count for each cause in descending order.
- Calculate the cumulative count percentage for each cause in descending order. 
  Percentage calculation: {Individual Cause Count} / {Total Causes Count}*100
- Create a second y-axis with percentages descending in increments of 10 from 100% to 0%.
- Plot the cumulative count percentage of each cause on the x-axis.
- Join the points to form a curve.
- Draw a line at 80% on the y-axis running parallel to the x-axis. 
- Then drop the line at the point of intersection with the curve on the x-axis. This point on the x-axis separates the important causes on the left (vital few) from the less important causes on the right (trivial many).
